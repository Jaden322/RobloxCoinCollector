A Roblox game where players collect coins scattered around the map. Made in **Lua** using Roblox Studio.  

---

## Project Description
This project lets players collect coins while the game is in progress. Collected coins are tracked per player and updated in real-time. I built this to practice **game logic, events, and simple animations** in Roblox.  

---

## How It Works
- Coins spawn at random spawner locations  
- Players collect coins by touching them  
- Collected coins play a **spin and rise animation**  
- Player coin totals are stored server-side and sent to their UI  

---

## What I Learned
- Writing **server-side scripts** in Roblox  
- Handling **events** like `Touched`  
- Using **TweenService** for animations  
- Tracking player data and syncing it with the client

## Demo
Check out the gameplay in the GIF above — coins spawn, players collect them, and their totals update in real-time!
